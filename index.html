<p>This article is about Earth's <abbr title=" an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another small Solar System body)." > <b> natural satellite </b></abbr>.

<p>The Moon is an astronomical body <em> orbiting Earth </em> and is the planet's only natural satellite. It is the <strong> fifth-largest </strong> satellite in the Solar System, and by far[13] the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the <strong> planet </strong> that it orbits.[f] The Moon is, after <em> Jupiter's </em> satellite Io, the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.</p>


<p> The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth" > not long after Earth</a>. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis"> giant impact </a> between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia. New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the <strong> Theia hypothesis </strong>, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.[14]</p>
